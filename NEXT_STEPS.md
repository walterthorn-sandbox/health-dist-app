## 🚀 Next: Push to GitHub

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

Go to: https://github.com/new

- Repository name: `health-dist-app`
- Description: "Voice-driven permit application system with synchronized mobile UI - POC"
- Public or Private (your choice)
- **Do NOT initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license
- Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Local Code to GitHub

```bash
# Add the remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/health-dist-app.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Set Up GitHub Project

Follow the detailed guide in [SETUP_GITHUB.md](./SETUP_GITHUB.md):

1. **Create Labels** (18 labels for organizing issues)
2. **Create Milestones** (4 milestones for each phase)
3. **Create Project Board** (kanban board for tracking progress)
4. **Create Issues** (52 issues from GITHUB_ISSUES.md)

**Quick Start**: At minimum, create Phase 1 issues to get started:
- Issues #1-13 from GITHUB_ISSUES.md

## 📋 Complete Task Overview

### Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure (Week 1) - 13 Issues
**Goal**: Working web form that saves to database, with admin interface

Key tasks:
- Set up Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Configure Vercel Postgres database
- Build basic web form
- Create admin list/detail views
- Test end-to-end flow

**Validation**: Form submission → Database → Admin view works

---

### Phase 2: Real-time Sync (Week 1-2) - 9 Issues
**Goal**: Mobile UI updates in real-time when API is called

Key tasks:
- Set up Ably account and integration
- Build session management system
- Create mobile UI page
- Connect Ably real-time updates
- Build test page to simulate updates

**Validation**: API update → Ably broadcast → Mobile UI reflects change (<1 sec)

---

### Phase 3: Voice Integration (Week 2-3) - 12 Issues
**Goal**: Complete voice call → mobile sync → database flow

Key tasks:
- Set up Twilio + OpenAI Realtime API
- Set up Braintrust for monitoring
- Build voice webhook handler
- Implement voice conversation flow
- Connect voice extraction to Ably
- Log everything to Braintrust

**Validation**: Call phone → speak answers → mobile updates → saves to DB

---

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Week 3-4) - 16 Issues
**Goal**: Production-quality POC ready for demo

Key tasks:
- Improve voice prompts and error handling
- Optimize latency and performance
- Add loading states and animations
- Comprehensive testing
- Create documentation and demo
- Security review

**Validation**: All POC success criteria met

---

## 🎯 POC Success Criteria

The POC is complete when:

- ✅ User can call phone number and complete application via voice
- ✅ User can simultaneously view form on mobile device
- ✅ Form updates in real-time as voice agent captures information (<1 sec latency)
- ✅ Completed application saves to database
- ✅ Admin can view list of applications and details
- ✅ Basic web form submission works (validates backend)

## 🛠️ Required Accounts

Before starting development, create accounts for:

1. **Vercel** - https://vercel.com
