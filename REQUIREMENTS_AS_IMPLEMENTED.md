# Food Establishment Permit Application System - As Implemented

## Project Overview
A proof-of-concept accessible system demonstrating voice-driven form completion with real-time mobile UI synchronization. The system enables food establishment owners and operators to apply for food establishment permits with the Riverside County Health District through multiple interfaces: web form and voice call with real-time mobile sync.

## Core Objectives Achieved
- **Accessibility First**: Voice interface for users who prefer voice interaction or have accessibility needs
- **Multi-Channel Access**: Mobile-optimized web form and voice call interfaces
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Web UI updates live as user speaks on voice call
- **Simplicity**: Streamlined data collection with minimal required fields
- **Reliability**: Applications tracked with unique IDs and stored in PostgreSQL database

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Fastify WebSocket Server
- **Database**: Vercel Postgres (Neon)
