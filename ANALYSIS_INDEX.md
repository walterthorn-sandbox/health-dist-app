## Critical Findings Summary

### Four Blocking Issues

| # | Issue | Impact | Timeline |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | No test coverage | Can't safely deploy | 2-4 weeks |
| 2 | Inadequate security | Data breach risk | 3-6 weeks |
| 3 | No monitoring | Can't detect failures | 2-3 weeks |
| 4 | Weak CI/CD | Bad code can merge | 1-2 weeks |

### What Works Well
- Clean, modern architecture (Next.js, TypeScript)
- Comprehensive technical documentation
- Voice integration (OpenAI Realtime API)
- Real-time mobile sync (Ably)
- Type-safe codebase
- Good error handling in APIs

### What's Missing
- Test infrastructure and coverage
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Security headers and protections
- Structured logging and APM
- Infrastructure as Code
- Automated deployments
- Data encryption at rest
