# üöÄ Remaining Work While Vercel is Down

## ‚úÖ Already Complete (Today)
- Issue #1-3: Next.js setup ‚úì
- Issue #6: Zod schemas ‚úì
- Issue #5: Database schema SQL ‚úì
- Issue #8: Web form UI ‚úì

## üî® What We Can Do Right Now (No Database Needed)

### High Priority - Can Complete Fully

#### 1. Issue #10: Admin List View UI ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
**Time: 30 minutes**
- Build the admin interface to view applications
- Use mock data for now
- Table/list layout with all fields
- Filtering UI (by name, date)
- Responsive design
- Connect to real API when database is ready

**Why do this:**
- Completes most of Phase 1
- Visual progress
- Can demo the full flow

---

#### 2. Issue #11: Admin Detail View UI ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
**Time: 20 minutes**
- Detail page for individual applications
- Display all submitted data
- Back button to list
- Clean, readable layout
- Use mock data for testing

**Why do this:**
- Pairs with #10
- Completes admin interface visually
- Just needs data connection later

---

#### 3. Issue #7: Database Utilities (Partial) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
**Time: 25 minutes**
- Create `src/lib/db.ts` with structure
- Define TypeScript interfaces
- Write function signatures for:
  - `createApplication()`
  - `getApplication()`
  - `getAllApplications()`
  - `createSession()`
  - `getSession()`
  - `updateSession()`
- Add error handling patterns
- Can't test connections, but structure ready

**Why do this:**
- Sets up clean architecture
- Ready to fill in when database available
- Documents the API we'll use

---

### Medium Priority - Useful Additions

#### 4. Create API Route Stubs
**Time: 15 minutes**
- `src/app/api/applications/route.ts` (POST, GET)
- `src/app/api/applications/[id]/route.ts` (GET)
- Structure in place, returns mock data
- Add TODO comments for database integration
- Update form to call real API endpoint

**Why do this:**
- Complete the flow (form ‚Üí API ‚Üí success)
- See real HTTP requests in browser
- Just swap mock data for real queries later

---

#### 5. Landing Page Enhancements
**Time: 20 minutes**
- Add FAQ section
- Add "What You'll Need" checklist
- Add screenshots/mockups section
- Improve copy and messaging

**Why do this:**
- Better user experience
- Professional polish
- Good for demo

---

#### 6. Create Loading Skeletons
**Time: 15 minutes**
- Add skeleton screens for admin list
- Add skeleton for admin detail
- Better UX while data loads

---

### Low Priority - Nice to Have

#### 7. Error Boundary Components
**Time: 15 minutes**
- Add React error boundaries
- Graceful error handling
- Better error UI

#### 8. Form Improvements
**Time: 20 minutes**
- Add form progress indicator
- Add field-level help tooltips
- Add "Save Draft" functionality (localStorage)

#### 9. Accessibility Improvements
**Time: 30 minutes**
- Add ARIA labels
- Improve keyboard navigation
- Add focus indicators
- Screen reader testing

## üìä Recommended Work Order

### Option A: Complete Admin UI (50 min) ‚≠ê BEST VALUE
1. Issue #10: Admin List View (30 min)
2. Issue #11: Admin Detail View (20 min)

**Result:** Admin interface 100% done visually, just needs data hookup

---

### Option B: Complete Backend Structure (40 min) ‚≠ê BEST PREP
1. Issue #7: Database utilities (25 min)
2. Create API route stubs (15 min)

**Result:** Backend architecture complete, ready for database

---

### Option C: Do Both! (90 min) üöÄ RECOMMENDED
1. Issue #7: Database utilities (25 min)
2. Create API route stubs (15 min)
3. Issue #10: Admin List View (30 min)
4. Issue #11: Admin Detail View (20 min)

**Result:** ~90% of Phase 1 complete! Just need database connection.

---

## üéØ My Recommendation

**Start with Option C** - Do both backend structure and admin UI.

This gives you:
- Complete admin interface (visual)
- Complete backend structure (code)
- Full application flow working end-to-end (with mock data)
- When Vercel is back: just connect database, run schema, swap mock ‚Üí real

**Estimated time to complete Phase 1 after Vercel recovery:** 15 minutes

---

## What Can't We Do (Blocked)

‚ùå Issue #4: Create Vercel Postgres database
‚ùå Issue #9: Test real form submission to DB
‚ùå Issue #12: CSV export (needs real data)
‚ùå Issue #13: End-to-end testing (needs DB)
‚ùå Deploy to production

---

## Question for You

Which would you like to tackle next?

**A)** Admin UI (#10, #11) - Most visible progress
**B)** Backend structure (#7, API stubs) - Best technical foundation
**C)** Both! - Maximum progress
**D)** Something else from the list above

I recommend **C) Both!** to knock out as much as possible while waiting.
