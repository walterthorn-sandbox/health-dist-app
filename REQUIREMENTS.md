# Food Establishment Permit Application System - POC Requirements

## Project Overview
A proof-of-concept voice-driven permit application system where users can complete a food establishment permit application via voice call while simultaneously viewing real-time form updates on their mobile device.

**POC Focus**: Demonstrate synchronized voice + mobile UI interaction for new permit applications. The core innovation is allowing users to speak their application details while watching the form populate in real-time on their phone.

## Core Objectives
- **Voice-First Design**: Enable users to complete the entire application via voice
- **Synchronized UI**: Real-time form updates visible on mobile device during voice call
- **Simplicity**: Prove the concept with minimal complexity
- **Foundation**: Build basic infrastructure to validate approach before scaling

## User Stories

### Primary User
Food establishment owner/operator applying for a new permit who prefers or requires voice interaction

### Core Use Case (POC)
**Voice + Mobile User**: "I want to call a number, speak with a voice agent to complete my permit application, and watch the form fill out in real-time on my mobile device as I provide information"

### Secondary Use Cases (Validation)
1. **Web Form Only**: "I want to fill out the permit application using just the web form" (validates backend is working)
2. **Admin User**: "I want to view all submitted applications in a simple list and see details of each submission"

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Basic Web Form Interface
**Purpose**: Validate backend is working correctly
- Simple form with all required fields
- Mobile-responsive design
- Basic validation
- Submission confirmation with tracking ID
- No real-time sync needed (static form submission)

### 2. Voice Agent with Synchronized Mobile UI (Core POC Feature)
**Voice Call Component**:
- Phone number for users to call
- Voice agent asks questions and collects responses
- Natural language processing to understand responses
- Ability to repeat questions
- Confirmation of captured information before final submission

**Synchronized Mobile UI Component**:
- Mobile web interface that displays the form
- Real-time updates as voice agent captures each field
- Visual progress indicator showing where in the application they are
- User can see their spoken responses populate the form fields in real-time
- Session linking (connect phone call to mobile device session)

**Session Management**:
- Generate unique session ID when user initiates voice call
- User accesses mobile UI via link/QR code/SMS with session ID
- WebSocket or similar real-time connection between voice backend and mobile UI
- Both voice and UI can update the same application data synchronously

### 3. Data Collection Requirements (Simplified for POC)

#### Required Information - New Permit Applications
- **Establishment Information**
  - Food establishment name
  - Street address
  - Phone number
  - Email address

- **Owner Information**
  - Owner name
  - Owner phone
  - Owner email

- **Operating Information**
  - Type of establishment (Restaurant, Food Truck, Catering, etc.)
  - Planned opening date

#### Data Validation
- Basic validation for required fields
- Email and phone format validation

### 4. Backend Requirements
- Store permit applications in database
- Generate unique session IDs for voice+mobile sessions
- Generate unique tracking IDs for submitted applications
- Timestamp all submissions
- Real-time sync capability (WebSocket or Server-Sent Events)
- REST API for form submission and retrieval

### 5. Admin Interface (Simple List/Detail View)
- List view showing all submitted applications
  - Establishment name
  - Submission date/time
  - Tracking ID
- Detail view showing complete application data
- No editing, workflow, or advanced features needed for POC

## Non-Functional Requirements (POC)

### Performance
- Mobile UI updates within 1 second of voice capture
- Voice agent responds within 2 seconds
- Form loads on mobile within 2 seconds

### Security & Privacy
- HTTPS encryption for all web traffic
- Secure WebSocket connections
- Secure voice communication channels
- Basic authentication for admin interface

### Language Support
- English only

## Technical Considerations

### Required Services/Tools
- Voice telephony service (e.g., Twilio, Vonage)
- Voice AI/NLP service (e.g., OpenAI Realtime API, Deepgram)
- Real-time sync infrastructure (WebSocket server or similar)
- Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Hosting infrastructure
- Optional: SMS service for sending session link to mobile device

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Mobile-responsive web app (React, Vue, or similar)
- **Backend**: API server with WebSocket support (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- **Voice Integration**: Telephony service connected to AI voice agent
- **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for voice ↔ mobile UI sync
- **Database**: Persistent storage for applications and session data

## Success Metrics (POC)
- Voice call successfully completes application flow
- Mobile UI successfully syncs in real-time with voice input
- Latency between voice capture and mobile UI update < 1 second
- Application data correctly saved to database
- Admin can view submitted applications

## POC Validation Criteria
✅ User can call phone number and complete application via voice
✅ User can simultaneously view form on mobile device
✅ Form updates in real-time as voice agent captures information
✅ Completed application saves to database
✅ Admin can view list of applications and details
✅ Basic web form submission works (validates backend)

## Out of Scope for POC
- Standalone chatbot interface (without voice)
- Permit renewals, transfers, status checks
- Payment processing and fee tracking
- Email/SMS confirmations and notifications
- Multi-language support
- Advanced admin features (editing, workflows, status management, notes)
- User authentication/accounts
- Data backup and disaster recovery
- Mobile native apps
- File attachments
- Full accessibility compliance (will be added post-POC)
- Complete form data from original requirements (simplified field set for POC)

## Future Enhancements (Post-POC)

### Phase 1: Complete Core Features
- Add complete form fields from original requirements
- Email/SMS confirmations
- Standalone chatbot interface (text-based, without voice)
- Improved admin interface with status management and search

### Phase 2: Additional Workflows
- Permit renewals workflow
- Permit transfers workflow
- Status check capability

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Multi-language support (Spanish, additional languages)
- Payment processing and fee tracking
- Reminder notifications
- User authentication and accounts
- File attachment support
- Advanced admin features (workflows, analytics, document generation)
- Full WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance

### Phase 4: Integration & Scale
- Integration with health district case management system
- Mobile native applications
- API for third-party integrations

## Assumptions (POC)
- Users have access to both a phone and mobile device (or computer with web browser)
- Voice telephony service can be procured for testing
- WebSocket or real-time sync technology is viable for this use case
- Simplified form fields are sufficient to prove the concept

## Constraints (POC)
- Must be built quickly to validate approach
- Should use cost-effective services for testing
- Focus on proving voice + mobile sync works

## Dependencies (POC)
- Selection of voice/telephony provider (e.g., Twilio)
- Selection of voice AI service (e.g., OpenAI Realtime API)
- Selection of hosting infrastructure for testing
- Basic infrastructure: web server, database, WebSocket server
