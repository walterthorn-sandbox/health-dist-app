# üîß Work Plan While Vercel is Down

## What We CAN Do Locally (No Database Needed)

While waiting for Vercel to recover, we can make excellent progress on these issues:

### ‚úÖ Issue #5: Prepare Database Schema SQL
**Status**: Can do now
**Output**: `sql/schema.sql` file ready to run once Vercel is up

We'll create the SQL schema file so it's ready to execute when the database is available.

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #6: Create Zod Validation Schemas
**Status**: Can do now
**Output**: `src/lib/schema.ts`

This is completely independent of the database! We'll define:
- Application data schema
- Field validation rules
- TypeScript types
- Error messages

**Benefits**:
- Type safety throughout the app
- Form validation ready
- Can be used by both frontend and backend

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #8: Build Basic Web Form UI
**Status**: Can do now
**Output**:
- `src/components/forms/PermitForm.tsx`
- `src/app/apply/page.tsx`

We can build the entire form UI with:
- All form fields
- Client-side validation using Zod
- Mobile-responsive design
- Loading/error states
- Form submission handler (will connect to API later)

**Note**: The form will be fully functional except for actual database submission

---

### üöß Issue #7: Database Utility Functions
**Status**: Can PARTIALLY do now
**Output**: `src/lib/db.ts`

We can:
- ‚úÖ Create the file structure
- ‚úÖ Define TypeScript types/interfaces
- ‚úÖ Write function signatures
- ‚úÖ Add error handling patterns
- ‚ùå Can't test database connection (need Vercel)

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #10: Create Admin List View
**Status**: Can do UI now
**Output**: `src/app/admin/page.tsx`

We can build the UI with:
- Layout and design
- Table/list structure
- Filtering UI components
- Pagination UI
- Mock data for development

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #11: Create Admin Detail View
**Status**: Can do UI now
**Output**: `src/app/admin/[id]/page.tsx`

Same as above - build the UI with mock data

---

## Recommended Work Order (Most Value First)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Issue #6: Zod Schemas** (15-20 min)
**Why first**: Everything else depends on these types
- Creates TypeScript types for the entire app
- Needed for forms, API routes, and database functions
- Zero dependencies

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Issue #5: Database Schema** (10 min)
**Why second**: Quick to write, ready when Vercel returns
- Define tables and relationships
- Have it ready to execute immediately
- Reference point for Zod schemas

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Issue #8: Web Form UI** (30-45 min)
**Why third**: Tangible progress, can demo
- Uses Zod schemas we just created
- Most visible progress
- Can be fully tested locally
- Fun to build!

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Issue #7: Database Utils (partial)** (15-20 min)
**Why fourth**: Set up structure for later
- Define interfaces and types
- Write function signatures
- Ready to fill in when database is available

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Issues #10-11: Admin UI** (30-40 min)
**Why last**: Nice to have, can use mock data
- Build out the admin interface
- Use mock data to test
- Connect to real data when database is ready

---

## What We CANNOT Do (Blocked by Vercel)

- ‚ùå Issue #4: Create actual Postgres database
- ‚ùå Issue #7: Test database connections
- ‚ùå Issue #9: Test form submission to database
- ‚ùå Deploy to production
- ‚ùå Pull environment variables

---

## Estimated Timeline (While Waiting)

**Total time available**: 2-3 hours of productive work

| Issue | Time | Cumulative |
|-------|------|------------|
| #6 Zod Schemas | 15-20 min | 20 min |
| #5 Database Schema | 10 min | 30 min |
| #8 Web Form UI | 30-45 min | 1h 15min |
| #7 DB Utils (partial) | 15-20 min | 1h 35min |
| #10 Admin List View | 20-25 min | 2h |
| #11 Admin Detail View | 15-20 min | 2h 20min |

**Result**: When Vercel comes back online, we'll be ~80% done with Phase 1! We'll just need to:
1. Run the database schema
2. Connect the database utilities
3. Test the full flow

---

## Let's Get Started!

**Recommended**: Start with Issue #6 (Zod Schemas)

This will give us:
- Type safety for the entire application
- Validation rules ready to use
- Foundation for the form we'll build next

Sound good? Should I start with creating the Zod schemas in `src/lib/schema.ts`?
